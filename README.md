Run `/NetworkCentralityCalculator/runApp.R` in an R environment.

You can now navigate to `localhost:3200` in your browser and calculate different ranking metrics on a test graph or upload your own graph.

## Ranking metrics

The tool offers 5 different ranking or "centrality" metrics 
* Degree Centrality
* Closeness Centrality
* Betweenness Centrality
* Eigenvector Centrality (PageRank)
* Dependency Centrality 

The meaning of the metrics, how they are calculated and how to use the tool is explained in the [paper](node_rankings_explained.pdf).
